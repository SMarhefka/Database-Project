-- 1.	Determine the date range of the records in the Temperature table

-- 1986-01-01	2017-05-09

select min(Date_Last_Change) as [First Date], max(Date_Last_Change) as [Last Date] from Temperature

-- 2.	Find the minimum, maximum and average temperature for each state
-- State_Name	Minimum Temp	Maximum Temp	Average Temp
-- Alabama	-4.662500		88.383333		59.328094

-- 3.	The results from question #2 show issues with the database.  Obviously, a temperature of -99 degrees Fahrenheit in Arizona is not an accurate reading as most likely is 135.5 degrees.  Write the queries to find all suspect temperatures (below -39o and above 105o). Sort your output by State Name and Average Temperature.

-- State_Name	state_code	County_Code	Site_Number	average_Temp	date_local
-- Wisconsin	55		059		0002		-58.000000		2002-03-28

-- Texas		48		141		0050		106.041667		1991-07-28
-- Texas		48		141		0050		106.291667		1991-07-25

-- 4.	You noticed that the average temperatures become questionable below -39 o and above 125 o and that it is unreasonable to have temperatures over 105 o for state codes 30, 29, 37, 26, 18, 38. You also decide that you are only interested in living in the United States, not Canada or the US territories. Create a view that combines the data in the AQS_Sites and Temperature tables. The view should have the appropriate SQL to exclude the data above. You should use this view for all subsequent queries.

-- 5.	Using the SQL RANK statement, rank the states by Average Temperature

-- State_Name	Minimum Temp	Maximum Temp	Average Temp	State_rank
-- Florida		35.96			88.00			72.244255		1
-- Louisiana	22.13			91.67			69.359993		2
-- Texas		0.00			122.60			68.906944		3




-- 6.	At this point, you’ve started to become annoyed at the amount of time each query is taking to run. You’ve heard that creating indexes can speed up queries. Create 5 indexes for your database. 2 of the indexes should index the temperature fields in the Temperature table, 1 index for the date in the Temperature table and 2 would index the columns used for joining the 2 tables (state, County and Site codes in the Temperate and aqs_site tables). 

-- To see if the indexing help, add print statements that write the start and stop time for the query in question #2 and run the query before and after the indexes are created. Note the differences in the times. Also make sure that the create index steps include a check to see if the index exists before trying to create it.

-- The following is a sample of the output that should appear in the messages tab that you will need to calculate the difference in execution times before and after the indexes are created

-- Begin Question 6 before Index Create At - 13:40:03
-- (777 row(s) affected)
-- Complete Question 6 before Index Create At - 13:45:18




-- 7.	You’ve decided that you want to see the ranking of each high temperatures for each city in each state to see if that helps you decide where to live. Write a query that ranks (using the rank function) the states by averages temperature and then ranks the cities in each state. The ranking of the cities should restart at 1 when the query returns a new state. You also want to only show results for the 15 states with the highest average temperatures.

-- Note: you will need to use multiple nested queries to get the State and City rankings, join them together and then apply a where clause to limit the state ranks shown.

-- State_Rank	State_Name	State_City_Rank	City_Name	   Average Temp
-- 1		Florida		1			Not in a City	   73.975759
-- 1		Florida		2			Pinellas Park	   72.878784
-- 1		Florida		3			Valrico		   71.729440
-- 1		Florida		4			Saint Marks	   69.594272
-- 2		Texas		1			McKinney	   76.662423
-- 2		Texas		2			Mission	   74.701098

-- 8.	You notice in the results that sites with Not in a City as the City Name are include but do not provide you useful information. Exclude these sites from all future answers. You can do this by either adding it to the where clause in the remaining queries or updating the view you created in #4

--  


-- 9.	You’ve decided that the results in #8 provided too much information and you only want to 2 cities with the highest temperatures and group the results by state rank then city rank. 

-- State_Rank	State_Name	State_City_Rank	City_Name		Average Temp
-- 1		Florida		1			Pinellas Park		72.878784
-- 1		Florida		2			Valrico			71.729440
-- 2		Louisiana	1			Baton Rouge		69.704466
-- 2		Louisiana	2			Laplace (La Place)	68.115400

-- 10.	You decide you like the average temperature to be in the 80's. Pick 3 cities that meets this condition and calculate the average temperature by month for those 3cities. You also decide to include a count of the number of records for each of the cities to make sure your comparisons are being made with comparable data for each city. 

-- Hint, use the datepart function to identify the month for your calculations.

-- City_Name	Month	# of Records	Average Temp
-- Mission	1	620		60.794048
-- Mission	2	565		64.403861
-- Mission	3	588		69.727512

-- 11.	You assume that the temperatures follow a normal distribution and that the majority of the temperatures will fall within the 40% to 60% range of the cumulative distribution. Using the CUME_DIST function, show the temperatures for the same 3 cities that fall within the range.

-- City_Name	Avg_Temp	Temp_Cume_Dist
-- Mission	73.916667	0.400686891814539
-- Mission	73.956522	0.400829994275902
-- Mission	73.958333	0.402404121350887 

-- 12.	You decide this is helpful, but too much information. You decide to write a query that shows the first temperature and the last temperature that fall within the 40% and 60% range for the 3 cities your focusing on.

-- City_Name	40 Percentile Temp	60 Percentile Temp
-- Mission	73.956522		80.083333
-- Pinellas Park	71.958333		78.125000
-- Tucson	63.750000		74.250000

-- 13.	You remember from your statistics classes that to get a smoother distribution of the temperatures and eliminate the small daily changes that you should use a moving average instead of the actual temperatures. Using the windowing within a ranking function to create a 4 day moving average, calculate the moving average for each day of the year. 

-- Hint: You will need to datepart to get the day of the year for your moving average. You moving average should use the 3 days prior and 1 day after for the moving average.

-- City_Name	Day of the Year	Rolling_Avg_Temp
-- Mission	1			59.022719
-- Mission	2			58.524868
-- Mission	3			58.812967

-- Mission	364			60.657749
-- Mission	365			61.726333
-- Mission	366			61.972514
